<h1>Google IT Support Certifications</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
The Google IT Support Certification gave me a comprehensive understanding of IT fundamentals. I dove into everything from hardware and software setup to troubleshooting and network management. I got hands-on with key technologies like modems, switches, routers, and hubs, and learned how to configure and maintain different OS platforms like Windows, Mac, and Linux. I also explored networking concepts like IP addressing, DNS, and DHCP, as well as the basics of cybersecurity, including firewalls and encryption. Plus, I gained experience with PowerShell commands for automation and scripting, and tackled real-world support scenarios that covered everything from OS installations to diagnosing connectivity issues. It was a deep dive into the tools, protocols, and best practices that make IT support tick.
